I created a dynamic Flutter app in Android Studio showcasing Chicagoâ€™s neighborhoods, events, and sports with custom UI elements, animated transitions, and interactive content screens. In addition, I integrated dynamic content updates, trivia features, and ensured a cohesive theme with customized text styling and background design for a polished user experience. Lastly, this repository only includes the dart files.
